### üìùOverview
This repository contains my **SQL assignment**, focused on **data querying, manipulation, and analysis** using SQL.  
Through this project, I learned how to extract meaningful insights from databases efficiently and effectively.  


### üõ† Skills & Techniques Learned

**Database Basics**
- Creating and managing databases and tables  
- Understanding primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints  
- Data types and schema design  

**Data Querying**
- Using `SELECT` statements to retrieve data  
- Filtering data with `WHERE` and logical operators  
- Sorting data with `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregating data with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  

**Joins & Relationships**
- Inner, Left, Right, and Full Joins  
- Combining multiple tables to extract insights  
- Understanding relational database concepts  

**Advanced SQL Techniques**
- Subqueries and nested queries  
- Using `CASE` statements for conditional logic  
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)  
- Data manipulation with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  

**Data Analysis & Reporting**
- Summarizing large datasets efficiently  
- Extracting trends, patterns, and insights  
- Preparing data for visualization in external tools  


### üìä Key Learnings
1. SQL is a **powerful language for managing and analyzing structured data**.  
2. Joins and subqueries enable complex analysis across multiple tables.  
3. Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) are essential for summarizing data.  
4. SQL is the backbone for **data-driven decision making** in real-world scenarios.
